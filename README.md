🛍️ Project Title:
Retail Sales Analysis and Prediction Using Linear Regression

📌 Project Description:
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting sales performance using a real-world retail dataset. It combines Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with predictive modeling to derive insights and forecast future sales.

🔍 Objectives:
1. Clean and explore retail transaction data.

2. Understand customer and product behavior through visual and statistical analysis.

3. Develop a sales prediction model using machine learning.

🧮 Key Steps Involved:
[1] Data Cleaning and Preparation:

- Removed missing values for data consistency.

- Converted date fields to proper datetime formats.

[2] Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Analyzed sales trends over time using line plots.

-Investigated customer demographics and their purchase behavior.

- Identified top-selling product categories.

- Used heatmaps to explore feature correlations.

[3] Data Visualization:

- Used bar plots, line plots, and pivot charts to communicate trends and patterns.

- Visualized monthly category-wise sales and demographic influences.

[4] Model Building:

- Built a Linear Regression model within a preprocessing pipeline.

- Applied One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables and Standard Scaling for numerical features.

[5] Model Evaluation:

- Evaluated the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.

- Visualized model performance using a scatter plot with a 45° reference line to compare actual vs predicted sales.

📈 Results:
* Achieved a strong model performance with R² ≈ 0.86.

* The model effectively captures patterns in customer behavior and pricing, making it suitable for forecasting sales.

* Found clear trends in product popularity and customer spending habits.
